# AdmissionImproved

This program outputs whether "admission" requirements have been met based on user input.

### Program Logic:

- Using the previous [Admission Program](https:\\github.com\josephestes\Admission), check for reasonable inputs (or reject un-reasonable ones) such as
  1. Negative GPA or test scores
  2. A GPA of 10
  3. A test score of more than 100
- Remain in a loop until a valid input is entered, then exit the loop
