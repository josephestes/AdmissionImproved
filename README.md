# AdmissionImproved - Input Testing

Here I modified my <https:\\github.com\josephestes\Admission Admission program to check for reasonable inputs (or reject un-reasonable ones). For example, a negative GPA or test score, or a GPA of 10 or a test score of more than 100. Typically this can be done with a loop. It should remain in a loop until a valid input is entered, then exit the loop.
