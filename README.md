# AdmissionImproved

This program decides whether requirements have been met based on user input.

### Program Guidelines:

- Modify the previous [Admission Program](https:\\github.com\josephestes\Admission) to check for reasonable inputs (or reject un-reasonable ones) such as a negative GPA/test score, a GPA of 10, and a test score of more than 100.
- Remain in a loop until a valid input is entered, then exit the loop
